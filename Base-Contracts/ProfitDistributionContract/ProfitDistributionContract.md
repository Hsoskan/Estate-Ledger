## Profit Distribution Contract

The Profit Distribution Contract manages the distribution of profits to stakeholders in a property development project.

### How it works?

The Profit Distribution Contract is designed to distribute profits to stakeholders based on predefined conditions and criteria. Here's a brief overview of how the contract functions:

- Stakeholders participate in the property development project by acquiring tokens representing their stakes.
- The contract tracks the total profit generated by the project.
- When specific conditions are met, such as reaching a certain profit threshold or a specified date, the contract triggers the distribution of profits to the stakeholders.
- The distribution of profits is proportionate to each stakeholder's token holdings in the project.
- The contract ensures transparency and fairness in profit distribution, providing stakeholders with a clear mechanism for receiving their share of profits.

#### Code Blocks and Explanations

- `when`:
    - This line introduces a `when` block, which specifies a condition or event that triggers a set of actions in the contract.
    - In the context of the Profit Distribution Contract, the `when` block is used to define the conditions under which profit distribution occurs.

- `then`:
    - This line starts a `then` block, which contains the actions to be taken when the event within the preceding `when` block occurs.
    - In the Profit Distribution Contract, the `then` block specifies the actions related to profit distribution.

- `total_profit`:
    - This line represents a variable named `total_profit` that keeps track of the total profit generated by the property development project.
    - The value of this variable is updated as the project generates profits over time.

- `distribute_profits`:
    - This line signifies a function or action named `distribute_profits` that handles the distribution of profits to stakeholders.
    - The implementation of this function determines how the profits are divided among the stakeholders based on their token holdings.

- `token_holders`:
    - This line defines an array or list named `token_holders`, which stores the addresses or identities of the stakeholders who hold tokens in the project.
    - The `token_holders` list is used to ensure that profits are distributed proportionately among the stakeholders.

- `calculate_profit_share`:
    - This line represents a function or action named `calculate_profit_share` that calculates the share of profits for each stakeholder.
    - The implementation of this function determines the specific criteria for calculating the profit share based on token holdings.

- `transfer_profits`:
    - This line denotes a function or action named `transfer_profits` that transfers the calculated profit share to each stakeholder.
    - The implementation of this function involves transferring the profits from the project's account to the individual accounts of the stakeholders.

- `timeout`:
    - This line sets a timeout value for the contract, specifying a date or timestamp when the contract's execution should be concluded.
    - When the specified timeout is reached, the contract will be closed or terminated, and further actions will not be possible.
